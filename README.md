- Run this command to start the project (I used Yarn as the package manager): 
- 
    yarn install 
    yarn start

- I used react-cedarmaps (an open source library) to display the latitude and longitude in a JSON file (I didn't  use Google Map API or any other maps as they are not free).
- As you said, I wrote all the codes without using any library, for example, the indicator was written without using any library like Ant Design, or Bootstrap to design the layout.

- I used five images and a random selection for the users.
