- Run this command to start the project (I used Yarn as the package manager): 
 
    yarn install 
    
    yarn start

- I used react-cedarmaps (an open source library) to display the latitude and longitude in a JSON file (I didn't  use Google Map API or any other maps as they are not free).
- I wrote all the codes without using any library, for example, the indicator was written without using any library like Ant Design, or Bootstrap to design the layout.

- I used five images and a random selection for the users.

- This page is designed for the admin, so all users can be selected.
  
- The user sidebar should be removed from the user page so that the other users are not visible to the user.  Therefore, it matches what the task specifies.
